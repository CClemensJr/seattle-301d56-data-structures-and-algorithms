# Reverse an Array
> Reversing an array of integers!

## Challenge
> Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
> For this challenge I used a for loop due to the simplicity involved. This resulted in an O(n) for time and space.
